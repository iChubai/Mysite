    In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, watching anime, and reading. Occasionally, I write about these hobbies on my blog to share my thoughts✍.

    As for my name, "Kinnari," it comes from a song I really like—*歌乐天* by Marblue ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/m-UhtKnaLQU?si=mLW5d3w0orEojeEG), [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hf4y1w7DE/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=c9e11661823ca4062db1ef99f7e0eee1)). The lyrics “Kinnariya mama taṇhā” left a deep impression on me with their mysterious and futuristic vibe, so I adopted it as my online name. (Kinnari is also God of song and dance in Indian Buddhism 🫣)
