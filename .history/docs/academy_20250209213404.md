## Bio

I am a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at the [SEIEE](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am an intern at [IPADS](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Xingda Wei](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/xingda_wei). You could find my previous experience [here](#experience). In addition, I am also an active participant in [Zhiyuan Honors Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), which fosters academic excellence and innovation.

> [!INFO] I am actively seeking internships in the field of machine learning systems and optimization. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any opportunities available! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
