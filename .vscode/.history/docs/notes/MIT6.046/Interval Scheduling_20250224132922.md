## Key Complexity Classes
- **P**: Solvable in polynomial time (e.g., shortest paths in $O(V^2)$).
- **NP**: Verifiable in polynomial time (e.g., Hamiltonian Cycle detection is NP-complete, but verification is easy).
- **NP-Complete**: A problem in NP that is as hard as any problem in NP. Solving one in polynomial time would solve all NP problems.

## Interval Scheduling
**Problem**: Select a maximum subset of non-overlapping requests.  
Each request has:  
- Start time $s(i)$  
- Finish time $f(i)$ (with $s(i) < f(i)$)  

**Compatibility**: Two requests $i$ and $j$ are compatible if:  
$$f(i) \leq s(j) \quad \text{or} \quad f(j) \leq s(i)$$

**Example**:

Requests 2 & 3 are compatible; 4, 5, 6 are compatible; 2 & 4 are not.

### Greedy Algorithms for Interval Scheduling
**Claim**: Greedy algorithm with **earliest finish time** yields an optimal solution.  

#### Possible Greedy Rules:
1. **Earliest Start Time**  
   ![](https://wy-static.wenxiaobai.com/chat-doc/c1dd0f8a649988fbc2fc9d72db6bb99e-image.png)  
   *Fails for overlapping long intervals*.

2. **Smallest Interval**  
   ![](https://wy-static.wenxiaobai.com/chat-doc/5434f92fdac8464964fc17960ef1a44e-image.png)  
   *Fails if small intervals block larger compatible ones*.

3. **Fewest Conflicts**  
   ![](https://wy-static.wenxiaobai.com/chat-doc/97a9e2855ce5511bd2153fb8f3903de2-image.png)  
   *Computationally expensive to track conflicts*.

4. **Earliest Finish Time**  
   *Optimal*.

### Proof of Optimality for Earliest Finish Time
**Inductive Proof**:  
- **Base Case**: $k^* = 1$ â€“ trivial.  
- **Inductive Step**: Assume optimality holds for $k^*$. For $k^* + 1$:  
  - Let $S^*$ be the optimal schedule. Greedy picks $i_1$ with $f(i_1) \leq f(j_1)$.  
  - Construct $S^{**} = \{i_1, j_2, \ldots, j_{k^*+1}\}$, which is also optimal.  
  - Residual problem $L'$ (intervals after $f(i_1)$) has optimal size $k^*$. By induction, greedy on $L'$ gives $k^*$ intervals.  
  - Total schedule size: $1 + k^* = k^* + 1$.

## Weighted Interval Scheduling
**Problem**: Maximize total weight of non-overlapping requests.  
- Greedy fails due to weights.  
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**:  
  Define $R^x = \{j \mid s(j) \geq x\}$. Recurrence:  
  $$\text{opt}(R) = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \left( w(i) + \text{opt}(R^{f(i)}) \right)$$  
  - **Time**: $O(n^2)$ (can be optimized to $O(n \log n)$).  

---

## Non-Identical Machines
**Problem**: Schedule jobs on $m$ machines where each job $i$ can only run on a subset $Q(i) \subseteq \{T_1, \ldots, T_m\}$.  
- **Complexity**:  
  - Decision version ("Can $k \leq n$ jobs be scheduled?") is **NP-Complete**.  
  - Optimization version ("Maximize scheduled jobs") is **NP-Hard**.

## Coping with Intractability
1. **Approximation Algorithms**: Guarantee near-optimal solutions in polynomial time.  
2. **Pruning Heuristics**: Reduce search space for practical instances.  
3. **Greedy Heuristics**: No guarantees but perform well empirically.
